# User Profile

This is a mock User Profile interface. The links are dead but editing functionality such as changing the profile picture, display name, bio, roles and filtering the table works.

To get set up run the following commands in the terminal:
- npm install
- (only if you get errors when running the third command) Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
- yarn start

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
